A Kanban board is a visual project management tool used to plan, track, and manage tasks in a workflow. It helps teams improve productivity and efficiency by visualizing the progress of each task in real time. The board is divided into columns such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done", representing different stages of the workflow.
